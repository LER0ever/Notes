Face-to-face Conversations<p>We are living in an era when technology expands much more rapidly than ever
before. Advancements of technology not only allow us to try things we have
never done before, but have made our life much easier in various aspects as
well, including inter-personal communication. We have been enjoying the
convenience of communication technology brought us since the new millennium
and it brings my concern of whether people actually have more efficient,
high-quality and enjoyable communication with the Modern Communication
Media (MCM). Through MCM, people usually get less focused and less serious,
and therefore there are much more emotional chatting and gossips than idea
exchanges and sincere conversations happening, which explains why people
nowadays are getting less satisfied with inter-personal communication as
they used to be. Thus instead of helping cope with communication barriers
as it is designed and commonly believed, MCM actually cast negative impacts
on inter-personal communication by reducing the quality, efficiency and
effectiveness of the conversations, and thereby offset the benefits they <a>provide</a>
<a id=_anchor_1 href=https://uwprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yrong9_wisc_edu/Documents/Documents/UWM-Notes-Files/UWM-S2E1/ESL118/Paper%201/Dalby.T.P1D3C.F17.RongEverette.docx#_msocom_1 name=_msoanchor_1>[TD1]</a>
.<p>The way people communicate changes with the pace of technological
advancements, because people seem to adopt the MCM really fast. Actually,
mobile phone adoption and usage enjoyed the most dramatic success as far as
the history of technology goes (Keshav, 2005, p. 84). As for the general
Internet, statistics show an increment of 976% since 2000 to 2017 (Internet
World Stats, 2017, p. 1), and among these, each month, one billion Internet
users actively used Facebook, 800 million used YouTube, 343 million used
Google+ and 200 million used Twitter and LinkedIn (Pick, 2013, p. 2).
Recent technological advancements have certainly caused huge changes in
people&#8217;s way of communication. Back to the time when we used to
communicate either face-to-face or through mails which could possibly take
days or months to deliver, people usually finished their conversation when
each other is present, or if they decided to leave the rest of the
conversation to postal mail, they would definitely write every letter
carefully. With today&#8217;s technology, the cost for communication is
really not as huge as it used to be, but the quality of it does not seem to
increase. The debate over whether people enjoy communication with MCM
started way back when cell phone went into people&#8217;s life and
continues to be heated until <a>today</a>
<a id=_anchor_2 href=https://uwprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yrong9_wisc_edu/Documents/Documents/UWM-Notes-Files/UWM-S2E1/ESL118/Paper%201/Dalby.T.P1D3C.F17.RongEverette.docx#_msocom_2 name=_msoanchor_2>[TD2]</a>
.<p>As most of us may assert, MCM bring much more convenience to our lives.
With the help of cell phones, communication between people is no longer
restricted by physical distance (Drucker &amp; Gumpert, 1991, p. 294). It
was hard to imagine talking to each other over a distance of thousands of
miles before the invention of telephone, and it was also hard to think
about talking to someone at home while walking in the streets before cell
phones came out. Cell phones truly allow people to communicate anywhere at
any time. In addition to cell phones, video conferencing also pushes
people&#8217;s communication experience forward towards a much more
pleasant fashion. Compared to just audio conferencing, like with cell phone
calls, video conferencing offers much more advantages. When communicating
over video, inter-personal awareness, which indicates the feeling of
whether someone is attending to themselves, is greatly enhanced
(Daly-Jones, Monk, &amp; Watts, 1998, p. 53), and inter-personal awareness
is vital for an effective communication. MCM improved greatly not only
people&#8217;s convenience of communication, but diversity of it as well.
The largest factor of that improvement is the invention of modern social
media. We used to do social interactions only when everyone is present,
like holding a meeting, having a party, or hanging out together. But with
social media, we are now able to see what is going on with our friends
regardless of time and location, and could even chat with a random stranger
if we want. These functionalities of MCM really enriched our social <a>experiences</a>
<a id=_anchor_3 href=https://uwprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yrong9_wisc_edu/Documents/Documents/UWM-Notes-Files/UWM-S2E1/ESL118/Paper%201/Dalby.T.P1D3C.F17.RongEverette.docx#_msocom_3 name=_msoanchor_3>[TD3]</a>
.<p>However, while enjoying the convenience MCM have brought to us, we cannot
ignore the detrimental effects that could neutralize the benefits they
provide. One of bad consequences is the impaired communication quality due
to people&#8217;s overdependence on MCM and the inevitable multitasking
when they use them. Since 1987, when cell phones roughly originate, the
frequency of face-to-face conversation dramatically dropped while the use
of electronic media <a>rose</a>
<a id=_anchor_4 href=https://uwprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yrong9_wisc_edu/Documents/Documents/UWM-Notes-Files/UWM-S2E1/ESL118/Paper%201/Dalby.T.P1D3C.F17.RongEverette.docx#_msocom_4 name=_msoanchor_4>[TD4]</a>
(Online networking &lsquo;harms health&rsquo;, 2009, p. 1). This means that we have
adopted these MCM really quickly and replaced our traditional face-to-face
conversations with MCM. And nowadays, more than 93 percent of Americans
have their own cell phones and over 72 percent of them have at least one
online social network profile. Because these MCM do not require the users
to pay full attention when using them to communicate with others, people
often chat with multiple people at the same time or even use MCM while they
are having a face-to-face conversation. However, plenty of research suggest
that most of us cannot truly multitask, and we tend to simulate
multitasking by constantly switching tasks from one to another (Bregman,
2010, p. 2). The costs of task switching are huge and can make people who
multitask 50 percent less efficient than people who focus on one task only
(Medina, 2010, p. 87). Psychologists David Strayer and Jason Watson (2012,
p. 24) also reported research concluding that our performance at any task
dramatically decreases when we try to focus on multiple items at a time.
These research results apply perfectly when people try to chat with several
people at the same time, they have to switch from one person&#8217;s
context to another&#8217;s and therefore they tend to have lower quality in
terms of communication with each person. Phubbing, a term referring to
snubbing people present by interacting with cell phones instead, involves
multitasking with both cell phones and people they are having a
conversation with, and can therefore also leads to lower communication
quality both for that person present and for the phone communication. In
fact, 70 percent of female among a sample of 143 reported being phubbed in
the interaction with their partners (McDaniel &amp; Coyne, 2014, p. 16).
MCM seem to be no longer able to provide better communication experience
and higher quality unless people try to avoid using their phone when
chatting and focus on one conversation at a time<a>.</a>
<a id=_anchor_5 href=https://uwprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yrong9_wisc_edu/Documents/Documents/UWM-Notes-Files/UWM-S2E1/ESL118/Paper%201/Dalby.T.P1D3C.F17.RongEverette.docx#_msocom_5 name=_msoanchor_5>[TD5]</a><p>Apart from communication quality problems, MCM tend to also reduce the
effectiveness of communication. In these MCM, people usually speak in
casual language and use emoji. According to Quintly, among a sample of
20000 Instagram users, 56 percent of them use emoji in their posts (Gottke,
2017, p. 1). However, emoji are represented in the Unicode indexes and
therefore different platforms appear to have different rendering of a same
emoji. For example, the emoji &#8220;U+1F601&#8221; on Android and other
Google products are rendered as &#8220;blissfully happy&#8221;, while on
Apple devices, they are interpreted as &#8220;ready to fight&#8221;
(Miller, et al., 2016, p. 260). These totally different interpretations of
the same emoji could definitely cause misunderstandings during
communications over MCM. Research by Miller el al. (2016) also suggests
that not just the platform rendering difference could cause the
misunderstanding, but two people looking at the same rendering of the same
emoji may interpret the semantic meaning differently (Miller, et al., 2016,
p. 266). This means that when we are using emoji in the conversation, it is
very likely that the person we are chatting with get a different
understanding of the information we try to deliver, and therefore emoji can
be detrimental to communication <a>effectiveness</a>
<a id=_anchor_6 href=https://uwprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yrong9_wisc_edu/Documents/Documents/UWM-Notes-Files/UWM-S2E1/ESL118/Paper%201/Dalby.T.P1D3C.F17.RongEverette.docx#_msocom_6 name=_msoanchor_6>[TD6]</a>
.<p>Even if people do not use emoji in MCM, they are less logical and not
likely to discuss serious topics over MCM. Therefore, the informality and
uninhibited emotions of conversation on MCM would also leads to lower
efficiency. Research shows that people are more likely to show negative
emotions or to become flaming over computer-mediated communication (Derks,
Fischer, &amp; Bos, 2008, p. 775). That is to say that people using MCM
tends to have stronger opinions when they see different points of view or
annoying problems, so they then may no longer be able to think and chat
objectively, which would reduce the efficiency of the whole conversation.
Also, according to Internet Culture, an Internet guide powered by
Wikipedia, people usually use shorthand or a complete different expression
for some of the English words (S&#248;holm, 2017, p. 97), which means
people who do not know those abbreviations or jargons may take longer time
to understand or have difficulties in getting the meaning of what others
are trying to say. Overall, people now are having much less efficiency
conversations over <a>MCM</a>
<a id=_anchor_7 href=https://uwprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yrong9_wisc_edu/Documents/Documents/UWM-Notes-Files/UWM-S2E1/ESL118/Paper%201/Dalby.T.P1D3C.F17.RongEverette.docx#_msocom_7 name=_msoanchor_7>[TD7]</a>
.<p>While MCM nowadays seem to have negative impacts on inter-personal
communications, we cannot ignore the dominant advantages of traditional
face-to-face conversation. Chatting over phones and the internet can be
really handy sometimes, but they are not supposed to eventually replace
face-to-face. Researchers from Beijing Normal University pointed out that
face-to-face communication differs from new communication media in the way
that it involves the integration of &#8220;multimodal sensory
information&#8221;, such as facial expressions and gestures, and it also
involves more continuous turn-taking behaviors between partners, which has
been shown to play a pivotal role in social interactions and reflects the
level of involvement of a person in the communication (Jiang, et al., 2012,
p. 16068). These factors help you synchronize your brain with others in
your conversation, and are critical to effective, high-quality
communications. That means people gets more connected and involved while
talking in-person and they are abler to follow what the other person says.
Apart from allowing people to connect their thoughts, face-to-face
conversation also improves creativity and quality of teamwork, as is
claimed by Gloor (2012, p. 396), as it increases inter-personal trust by
eye contacts and face-to-face interaction. It is almost a common sense that
trust is vital for a team. If team members trust each other, they would
devote more to the team activity and be more actively engaged in idea
exchanges, which leads to more creative and higher quality teamwork. It is
because of these unique advantages that other modern forms of communication
lack that make the so-called &#8220;traditional&#8221; face-to-face
conversations <a>irreplaceable</a>

.<p>There is no doubt that MCM have brought much convenience to our
communication and they have done a great job coping with communication
barriers of physical distances, but we also cannot ignore the facts that if
not used properly they can be detrimental to the quality, effectiveness and
efficiency of our communication. Although we cannot and should not totally
eliminate the use of MCM, we really ought to maintain the amount of daily
face-to-face conversation and take MCM as a complementary way of
communication.</p><br clear=all><h1 align=center>Reference<a>s</a>
