and how they vary across social situations.<h4 id=current-perspective-to-look-at-during-the-semester>Current perspective to look at during the semester</h4><p>//TODO: fix this<ol><li>Psychodynamic<ul><li>Emphasize unconscious and dynamic process</ul><li>Humanistic<li>Cognitive<li>Behavior<li>Psychobiological</ol><h4 id=freud-typographical-iceburg-model>Freud Typographical (iceburg) Model</h4><p>Freud believed that conscious awareness was only a small fraction of mental activity.
That is, conscious awareness represented the proverbial tip of the iceberg,
with most mental processes buried under the surface.<p>The conscious level consists of the thoughts that people are aware of.
The preconscious level consists of content that is not currently in awareness but that could be brought to awareness.
This level is roughly analogous to long-term memory.
The unconscious level contains material that the mind cannot easily retrieve,
including hidden memories, wishes, desires, and motives.<h4 id=freud-structural-model>Freud Structural Model</h4><p><strong>Identify the features of this model and how they overlap with the iceberg model</strong><h6 id=terms>Terms</h6><p><strong>id:</strong>
In psychodynamic theory, the
component of personality that
is completely submerged in the
unconscious and operates according
to the pleasure principle.<p><strong>superego:</strong>
In psychodynamic theory, the
internalization of societal and parental
standards of conduct.<p><strong>ego:</strong>
In psychodynamic theory, the
component of personality that tries
to satisfy the wishes of the id while
being responsive to the dictates of the
superego.<p>In this model, personality consists of three interacting structures,
and these structures vary in their access to consciousness.
The relative strengths of these structures are primarily responsible for an individual’s personality.<p>The first structure, the id, exists at the most basic level: completely submerged in
the unconscious. The id operates according to the pleasure principle, which directs
the person to seek pleasure and to avoid pain.<p>The second structure, the superego, acts as a brake on the id. Largely unconscious,
the superego develops in childhood and is the internalization of parental and societal
standards of conduct. It is a rigid structure of morality, or conscience.<p>The third structure, the ego, mediates between the id and the superego. That is, the
ego tries to satisfy the wishes of the id while being responsive to the dictates of the
superego. The ego operates according to the reality principle, which involves rational thought and problem solving.
Some aspects of the ego’s operations are open to conscious awareness.<h4 id=freud-psychosexual-model>Freud Psychosexual Model</h4><p><strong>psychosexual stages</strong>
According to Freud, developmental
stages that correspond to distinct
libidinal urges; progression through
these stages profoundly affects
personality.<p>In each psychosexual stage, libido is focused on one of the erogenous zones: the
mouth, the anus, or the genitals. The oral stage lasts from birth to approximately 18
months. During this time, infants seek pleasure through the mouth. Because hungry
infants experience relief when they breast-feed, they come to associate pleasure with
sucking. When children are 2 to 3 years old, they enter the anal stage. During this time,
toilet training—learning to control the bowels—leads them to focus on the anus. From
age 3 to 5, children are in the phallic stage. That is, they direct their libidinal
energies toward the genitals. Children often discover the pleasure of rubbing their
genitals during this time, although they have no sexual intent per se. The phallic stage is
followed by a brief latency stage. During this time, children suppress libidinal urges
or channel them into doing schoolwork or building friendships. Finally, in the genital
stage, adolescents and adults attain mature attitudes about sexuality and adulthood.
They center their libidinal urges on the capacities to reproduce and to contribute to
society.<blockquote><p>Page 559 (606 / 862)</blockquote><h4 id=defense-mechanisms>Defense Mechanisms</h4><p><strong>defense mechanisms:</strong>

anxiety.<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/RYOUKkV.png alt="defense mechanisms"><h4 id=purposes-of-defense-mechanisms>Purposes of defense mechanisms</h4><p>Conflicts between the id and the superego lead to anxiety. The ego then copes with
anxiety through various defense mechanisms: unconscious mental strategies that the
mind uses to protect itself from distress.<h2 id=personality>Personality</h2><h4 id=define-personality-in-your-own-word>Define personality in your own word</h4><h4 id=what-are-constructs-and-how-are-they-measured>What are constructs and how are they measured</h4><p><strong>Constructs are theoretical-hypothetical ideas for which we seek evidence via the scientific method</strong><ul><li>Our scientific measures yield scores on “variables”<li>Statistically, scores on variables are distributed across a range of values with a:<ul><li>Mean<li>Average<li>Standard Deviation</ul></ul><h4 id=personality-tests>Personality Tests</h4><h6 id=subjective-vs-objective-tests>Subjective vs. Objective tests:</h6><p><strong>Projective measures:</strong> Personality tests that examine unconscious processes by having people interpret ambiguous stimuli.

This expectation
helps mobilize your energies. If you have low self-efficacy - that is, if you do not believe
your efforts will pay off - you may be too discouraged even to study. People with high
self-efficacy often set challenging goals that lead to success. Sometimes, however, people
whose self-views are inflated set goals that they cannot possibly achieve. Again, goals that
are challenging but not overwhelming are usually most conducive to success.<h6 id=which-psychology-professor-is-associated-with-this>Which Psychology professor is associated with
